# Markov-Chain-Applications-Research
Exploring applications of major domains of Markov Chain (such as HMM, MCMC, etc) along with reinforcement learning researches (MDP, Q-Learning, DQN,...)
The repo also contains introductionary notes for those who are new to Markov Chain (start with the first order markov chain folder) along with some scattered notes that i've gathered from various sources such as Youtube videos, ChatGPT, Books, etc.  

The respository also includes two sub-projects in which I maintain in their respective respository:
1. [Part-Of-Speech tagging for Persian using a Hidden Markov Model](https://github.com/Arsalanjdev/POS-HMM-Farsi)
2. [Automated driving in highway env with CNN and DQN](https://github.com/Arsalanjdev/Automated-driving-in-highway-env-with-CNN-DQN)
